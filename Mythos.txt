In the earliest part of history people noticed the light and they noticed the dark.
They noticed the effects of both and started to pray and make sacrifices to them for their favor.
Thus two gods where created amidst the shrieking invocations and fountains of blood they formed.
One radiant has only a new born sun.
	Nothing can hide from it,
	Nor can anything tarnish it.
	Sight-of-all is its right.
	Knowledge never-ending its gift.
The other shadow-filled and ethereal.
	Concealing is its business.
	enigma's and fear's it spreads,
	wherever its foot falls.
	The gift this entity gives..
	Is the gift of the unknown.
	

In time these entities began to squabble over what was true and what was false, right and wrong.
For their natures where counter to each other.
and from their squabbling turmoil bleed to the mortals.
The follows of darkness and light started to challenge/resent one from the other.
Eventually war was made.
Both darkness and light twirled 'round each other,clawing/biting/casting magiks.
and in their fervor the essence of the gods mixed. 
and has it mixed some of their followers started to doubt their blind-faith,
the doubters started to try and quell the blood-lust in their fellows.
From the mixing and the doubt a third entity was created.
One who doubted,
and prefered logic to blind-faith/obedience.
Twilight was his domain,
for neither light 
nor darkness was he.

This all accured many ages before the events in the game, though there are some that still believe
in darkness,light,and twilight.
